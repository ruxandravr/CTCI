Cracking the Coding Interview book implementations(C++)

Contains: 
  - My own Data Structures
    - Vector
    - LinkedList
    - Hashtable
  - Tests for each Data Structure 

Uses GTEST as unit testing platform. For using it, run "cmake CMakeLists.txt" in Data_Structures/ which creates the Makefile (then "make" to build the test binaries). To run a certain test (for example "nodeTest", just run it from Data_Structures directory). "make clean" deletes all the test binaries.
